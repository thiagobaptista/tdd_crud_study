[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thiagobaptista/tdd_crud_study.png)](https://travis-ci.org/thiagobaptista/tdd_crud_study)

A small study on Test-driven, incremental building CRUD development.

I would encourage anyone interested in doing so to accompany this study through this project's git logs and commit history.

The best option to do this is the repository's own Github commit history page at this link: https://github.com/thiagobaptista/tdd_crud_study/commits/master.

Commits are conveniently named after the TDD cycle's state they were at the moment between brackets - [RED], [GREEN] and [REFACTOR] - followed by the actual commit message, so accompanying it through should be a bliss.
